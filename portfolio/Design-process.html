                    <p>On February 19, 2014, TMZ posted video footage of Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice dragging his then-fiancé, Janay Palmer, out of an elevator at the Revel Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The incident had taken place just a few days earlier, on February 15. On March 27, 2014, despite his plea of not guilty, Ray Rice was indicted on a charge of third-degree aggravated assault and was suspended for the first two games of the 2014 NFL season.</p>

                    <p>The case was prosecuted by the State of New Jersey, which later dropped the felony assault chargers against Ray Rice when he agreed to court-supervised counseling.</p>

                    <p>Months later, on Monday, September 8, 2014, TMZ posted leaked security camera footage of what happened in the elevator, and it was graphic: Ray Rice can be seen punching Janay in a blow that immediately knocks her out.

                    <p>It wasn’t just individuals who were partaking in the victim blaming. On the show &ldquo;Fox &amp; Friends&rdquo;, Fox News hosts seemed to make light of the abuse. Host Brian Kilmeade laughed while saying, &ldquo;The message is, take the stairs.&rdquo; His co-host Steve Doocy smiled as he added his two cents: &ldquo;The message is when you’re in an elevator, there’s a camera.&rdquo;</p>

                            <p>Bev Gooden, one of the criticisms of your initial posts were that it kind of kept the focus on the victims. And similarly with these, that the idea is still kind of having the victims explain instead of focusing on maybe why the perpetrators are acting the way they do. How did you feel about the way the conversation evolved online?</p>

                            <p>Well, I think the development of the additional hashtags #WhenILeft and #WhyILeft was kind of the natural progression of the conversation. I was afraid at first that it would detract from the women who may not have left and kind of isolate them again. But I think with all the criticisms, the key for me is that #WhyIStayed isn't an endorsement of staying in an abusive relationship. You know, rather it's simply providing an answer to society's question. They asked and we answered. There are many reasons why someone would stay. And domestic violence isn't cut and dry. It's not easy, you know, to just say well, he hit you, you'll leave. It's very complex.”</p>

                    <p>In the social media world, the #WhyIStayed conversation took place almost entirely on Twitter. However, media coverage of the hashtag was extensive, in large part due to Bev’s advocacy, who penned <a href="http://kristof.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/13/why-we-stayed/?smid=pl-share&_r=0" target="_blank">an article for the NY Times</a> and even <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/american-football-nfl-domestic-violence-survivor-video" target="_blank">appeared on a British news channel</a>.</p>
                    <p>Some members of the media were inspired to share the story of their personal experiences with domestic violence using their own media outlets, including <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/american-football-nfl-domestic-violence-survivor-video" target="_blank">Meredith Vieira on her talk show</a> and <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/09/health/domestic-abuse-willingham/index.html" target="_blank">a CNN staffer in an article</a> posted on their website.</p>
