                    <p>Then I got into the design thinking bootcamp, a fast-paced course in user experience design. I was one of the 30 people chosen from all over Stanford to attend the course and participate in 3 design projects. It was here at the Stanford d.School (<a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu" target="_blank">the Hasso Plattner Institute of design</a>) that I learned the true essence of human-centered design process.</p>

                    <p>I learned that it is more important to step out of the room and into the shoes of the users to design the best solutions. And the rest is history.</p>

During this time, my design principles kept evolving and the following picture captures a snapshot of that evolution.

                            <p>Bev Gooden, one of the criticisms of your initial posts were that it kind of kept the focus on the victims. And similarly with these, that the idea is still kind of having the victims explain instead of focusing on maybe why the perpetrators are acting the way they do. How did you feel about the way the conversation evolved online?</p>

                            <p>Well, I think the development of the additional hashtags #WhenILeft and #WhyILeft was kind of the natural progression of the conversation. I was afraid at first that it would detract from the women who may not have left and kind of isolate them again. But I think with all the criticisms, the key for me is that #WhyIStayed isn't an endorsement of staying in an abusive relationship. You know, rather it's simply providing an answer to society's question. They asked and we answered. There are many reasons why someone would stay. And domestic violence isn't cut and dry. It's not easy, you know, to just say well, he hit you, you'll leave. It's very complex.‚Äù</p>

                            <p>‚ÄúYou know, I think the beauty of hashtag activism is that it creates an opportunity for sustained engagement, which is important for any cause. So you never know what a hashtag has inspired someone to do off-line. You know, the hope is that the hashtag will inspire action. There was a woman who - I think it was two weeks ago now - she tweeted to me that #WhyIStayed helped her get out and stay out. And if that's not direct action, I don't know what is.‚Äù</p>
